            <p>
              Hi, I'm Bhavesh R. Sadhu, a passionate and driven web developer
              with a strong foundation in front-end development. Over the years,
              I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React,
              creating dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.
              Currently, I am expanding my skill set by diving into back-end
              development using Express and Node.js as part of my ongoing
              learning journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a Masterâ€™s degree in Information Technology and hands-on
              experience through personal and professional projects, I strive to
              build solutions that are both efficient and engaging. I have
              worked on several projects ranging from interactive web apps to
              full-stack applications, and I enjoy tackling new challenges that
              help me grow as a developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am eager to collaborate with dynamic teams, contribute to
              innovative projects, and continue expanding my knowledge in both
              front-end and back-end development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Feel free to browse through my projects and get in touch if you'd
              like to connect or discuss opportunities!
